# About

My name is Gerald Ryan and this is one of my solo projects, a Full-Stack React app currently called Fitness Anywhere. 

View the website here:
[Fitness Anywhere Front-End](https://fitness-anywhere-bw.netlify.app/classes)

The technologies I'm using for this project:

HTML, CSS, Styled Components, Javascript, React, React-router, Netlify

Clients and Instructors have the ability to register accounts and log in and log out. Instructors can create, edit, and delete their currently available classes. Clients are able to view and register for available classes.

More features to come!
